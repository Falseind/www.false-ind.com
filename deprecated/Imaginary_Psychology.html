						<!-- <h3>Biography Heading of Artist</h3> -->
						<p>False Industries 10th is from a dear friend and a unique musician: Matt Baldwin from San Francisco, its an EP that fuses psychedelic music with classic cosmic\kraut sounds that brings to mind guitarist like: Manuel Gottsching (Ashra) and Michael Rother (Neu!\Harmonia). 
I got to meet Matt when he was playing a show with my band in Tel Aviv. We became friends, after some discussions, we both decided to re issue, "Imaginary Psychology". It was released before on Matt's CDR label in limited edition, and did not get proper mastering.
Matt Baldwin's early releases were more in the vein of "American Primitive" folk, playing mainly on acoustic guitar. His first album, "Paths of Ignition", was released on American Dust, and was critically acclaimed. Although a labeled as folk album, one could hear, that Matt is not one dimensional artist, and that Matt seeks a path which is non conventional (starting an album with an acoustic version of a NEU! Tune for example).</p>
						<p>His 2nd album "Nights in the triangle", which was also released on American Dust label, showed that Baldwin's music is evolving his compositions and sound deeply into another domain. This album is electric and the subtle past affiliations with electronic music and Kraut rock are now bluntly in the center of his creation.<br>Original release consists of 3 tunes; Where Matt is playing on electric guitar and wide array of effects. Although he is fascinated with 70s German guitarist, Matt Baldwin keeps his own unique voice, and we here at False Industries, love his sonic and musical palette.</p>
						<p>Opening tune "Lindsay and her duplicates" is a 15 minutes psychedelic trip of looped guitar. Deeply into space, from the starting with lovely overdubs, that sounds like a rough version of a NEU! Tune. Matts starts to add lovely synth lines and spaced out melodies, one cant believe, this whole composition, was recorded in one time.</p>
						<p>Imaginary Psychology starts in a very gentle way. Its a bit of a folk tune with lovely loops and overdubs, but Slowly Matt is adding his trademark whooshes and killer synth sounds, making this tune very psychedelic, very cosmic yet very fresh.
"Borkian dervish thomas de hartmann & gi gurdjieff", is short and calm guitar affair. Where Baldwin shows a lot of heart of good sense for melodies.</p>
						<p>To add more value we wanted to add remixes to this release, it was very obvious to choose Yair Yona and Maps and Diagrams. In a sense both artists have strong connection musically with Matts music. Yair Yona made a name for himself with two releases on the label "Strange Attractions". Like Matt Yair was always trying to evolve his music and compositions. Both started with basic framework of Folk music, but engineered it to fit their own personal ambition.</p>
					    <p>Maps and Diagrams, was the second artist I choose since for me Tim's and Matt's works are similar, since both are using different tools and frameworks. But both are making music, which have the same feel. Both create music that borrows references from the same past, yet their music is very fresh and very personal and very much located in our time. Saying its got a sort of nostalgic sentiment, yet its not nostalgic per say.</p>
                         <p>Tim has also shown work for a Chilean art collective Citypulse and has been involved in exhibitions around the world, exhibiting his photography and contributing sound design and soundtracks for the exhibitions and is currently curating the "city::genetic" project involving musicians around the world.</p>
                         <p>Yair Yona is an Israeli musician; he plays bass in our band Farthest South, he is also a guitar player with releases on strange attractions. Both his albums were super welcomed in our home stereo. He took "Borkian dervish_thomas de hartmann & gi gurdjieff", and added to the original backing guitars and mellow pads\effects to make his remix feel like a daydream in a park.</p>
                         <p>Maps and Diagrams is one of our regulars here at False Industries, he takes "Borkian dervish_thomas de hartmann & gi gurdjieff" and turn it into a freakish texture affair. </p>
                         <p>Artwork is done by Tuvia Kudashevitz. 
Mastering by Manes@Salz Mastering.
